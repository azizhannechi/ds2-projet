                        <p>Hamas militants breached Israeli checkpoint locations along the border with Gaza, neutralizing Israeli forces, and allowing Hamas to spread into nearby towns. With hundreds killed, the attack is the largest and deadliest in years, prompting an Israeli declaration of war</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>At various points in the conflict, Hamas and other Gaza-based militants have fired rockets toward populated areas in Israel. Israel initially halted supplies from Israeli territory to Gaza of electricity, food, and fuel. Since then, Israelâ€”via consultations with U.S. and U.N</p>
                        <p>On the morning of 7 October, waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets.
                            Those killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival.</p>
                        <p>Hamas took more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages..</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is hamas and why is it fighting Israel ?</h2>
                        <p>Hamas became the sole ruler of Gaza after violently ejecting political rivals in 2007.
                            It has an armed wing and was thought to have about 30,000 fighters before the start of the war.</p>
                        <p>The group, whose name stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, wants to create an Islamic state in place of Israel. Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction.</p>
                        <p>Hamas justified its attack as a response to what it calls Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why is Isael fighting in Gaza</h2>
                        <p>Israel immediately began a massive campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, in response to the Hamas attack.
                           Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages.

                        <p>Israel launched a ground invasion three weeks later. It has also bombarded Gaza from the sea.
                            Attacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it, which Israel said were the centre of military operations by Hamas.
                            All 1.1 million people living in the north were ordered by Israel to evacuate south for their safety.</p>
                        <p> the result of this attack around 1,200 Israelis died, and 5,431 were injured.
                             Through retaliation attacks by the Israeli armed forces against Hamas in Gaza, 33,797 Palestinians were killed, and 76,465 were injured.</p>
